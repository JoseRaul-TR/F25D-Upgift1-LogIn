The main purpose of this web page is to provide a login interface for customers. It also offers links to the contact and about us pages. The design is clean and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on various devices.

## Features

- **User Login:** A form for users to enter their email and password to log in.
- **Remember Me:** A checkbox to remember the user's login.
- **Registration Option:** A button that could lead to a user registration page.
- **Navigation:** A header with links to the "Kontakt", "Om oss", and "Logga in" pages.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Footer:** Contains copyright information, contact email, and links to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you simply need a web browser. Save the provided HTML content as an `.html` file (e.g., `login.html`) and the CSS content in a folder named `Styles` as `style.css` in the same directory. Then, open the `login.html` file in your web browser.

No server-side setup is required for viewing the static HTML and CSS.

## Structure

The project structure would be as follows:

├── index.html        (Likely the homepage, referenced in the header)
├── login.html        (The current login page)
├── contact.html      (Link in the navigation)
├── about.html        (Link in the navigation)
└── Styles/
    └── style.css     (The main CSS file)

The `login.html` file contains the HTML structure, and `/Styles/style.css` contains the styling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout, including responsive design.
- **Font Awesome:** For icons (e.g., email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
